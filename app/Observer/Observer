// OBSERVER DESIGN PATTERN
// ============================================

/**
 * WHAT IS OBSERVER PATTERN?
 *
 * The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (Subject)
 * maintains a list of dependents (Observers) and notifies them automatically
 * when its state changes.
 *
 * REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
 * Think of YouTube subscriptions:
 * - YouTuber (Subject) posts a new video
 * - All subscribers (Observers) get notified automatically
 * - Subscribers can subscribe or unsubscribe anytime
 * - YouTuber doesn't need to know who the subscribers are
 *
 * ANOTHER ANALOGY:
 * Newspaper subscription:
 * - Newspaper (Subject) publishes daily
 * - Subscribers (Observers) receive it automatically
 * - Can subscribe/unsubscribe anytime
 *
 * COMPONENTS:
 * 1. Subject: The object being watched (the "publisher")
 * 2. Observer: Objects that want to be notified (the "subscribers")
 * 3. ConcreteSubject: Actual implementation of Subject
 * 4. ConcreteObserver: Actual implementation of Observer
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - When one object changes and others need to react
 * - When you want loose coupling between objects
 * - When you don't know how many objects need to be notified
 * - Event-driven systems
